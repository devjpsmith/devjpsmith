- 👋 Hi, I’m @devjpsmith. I'm a software developer, currently specializing in .NET applications.
- 👀 I’m interested in strengthening my front end skills, so a lot of my recent commits are in that area.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about CSS, but also exploring other backend architectures like NodeJS for APIs
